# transformer_translation_demo
This is a small demo of simple transformer capabilities for my team, using PyTorch, spacy, and some publicly available data.

This code is an adapted form of the Seq2Seq transformer tutorial at https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/translation_transformer.html, instead using public data and with a greater emphasis on OOP.
